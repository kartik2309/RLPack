# Distributions {#distributions}

RLPack provides in-built way to access and pass required distribution type to agents, which is also accessible by 
keywords for use in `rlpack.simualator.Simulator` or `rlpack.simulator_distributed.SimulatorDistributed`. Take a 
look below to learn more about available distributions and their corresponding keywords. 

| Distribution            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Keyword                         |

| `MultivariateLogStd`    | The Multivariate Normal distribution (for continuous action spaces) just like `MultivariateNormal` but assumes covariance matrix (cov_mat) is of form log(cov_mat). This is implemented in rlpack.distributions.multivariate_normal_log_std.MultivariateNormalLogStd                                                 | `"multivariate_normal_log_std"` |
| `GaussianMixture`       | The Gaussian Mixture distribution for given independent mean and standard deviations. This is implemented in rlpack.distributions.gaussian_mixture.GaussianMixture. This currently does not support `rsample` to compute pathwise derivative.                                                                        | `"gaussian_mixture"`            |
| `GaussianMixtureLogStd` | The Gaussian Mixture distribution for given independent mean and standard deviations but assumes standard deviation (std) is of form log(std). This is implemented as rlpack.distributions.gaussian_mixture_log_std.GaussianMixtureLogStd. This currently does not support `rsample` to compute pathwise derivative. | `"gaussian_mixture_log_std"`    |

Note that some distributions are implemented in PyTorch which is fetched by RLPack from PyTorch. Some distributions are 
implemented in RLPack in `rlpack.distributions`.
